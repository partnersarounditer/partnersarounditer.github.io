One year of efforts has been made by two entities of the CNIM Group to submit a successful offer to F4E for the supply of the In-Vessel Viewing System (IVVS), a remote handling system dedicated to visual inspection and metrology of the tokamak inner walls between two plasma shots. The framework contract has been signed in November 2015 and is expected to last 7 years. Bertin Technologies will take care of the optical probe, the control system and the image processing unit, whereas CNIM Industrial Systems will supply the deployment system. After design and qualification, 6 IVVS units will be manufactured and installed in ITER tokamak. The complementary skills of Bertin Technologies and CNIM Industrial System will be completed by the expertise of subcontractors such as Millennium, CEA-LIST, G2Metric and MagICs. Works have started in the early days of 2016 and are focusing on mobilization of the project team and review of the input data.
