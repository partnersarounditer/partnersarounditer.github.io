On December 2015, F4E and CNIM Industrial Systems have signed the contract related to the manufacturing and cold testing of the 4 largest Poloidal Field Coils of ITER. The relevant activity will take place in the existing PF Coils Building located next to the Tokamak building, on the ITER site. The first staff members have moved to Cadarache in the early days of 2016 and the overall staff is expected to reach 50 at the highest activity period. The overall on-site work of 300000 hours shall be completed within 4.5 years.
CNIM is familiar with demanding manufacturing activities, but it is the first time that such activity will be carried out outside CNIMâ€™s facilities.
