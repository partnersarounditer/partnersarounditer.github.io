By signing a contract with the ITER Organization in December 2015, CNIM Industrial Systems becomes the provider of the specific tools required for the assembly of in-vessel components such as coils, blanket manifolds, shielding blocks, first wall panels, etc. The scope includes the design, manufacturing and qualification of handling equipment, as well as the staging required for man access. A trial test and training facility will also help testing tools and training future operators. In order to comply with the ITER assembly schedule, the contract is split into Phase 1 and Phase 2, with an expected duration of 3.5 years.
