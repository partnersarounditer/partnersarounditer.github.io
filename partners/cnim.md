For over a century, the CNIM Group designs and produces turnkey industrial solutions in the fields  of environment, energy, defense, nuclear and big science.

Within the Group, CNIM Industrial Systems and Bertin Technologies (another PAI member) are located close to the ITER site and can provide a wide range of products and services:

* Manufacturing of large size mechanical components, using cutting edge technologies, such as EB welding;
* Design, manufacture and installation of complex systems, with expertise in remote handling systems;
* Design and supply of diagnostics and metrology systems;
* Local support to site works, thanks to CNIMâ€™s Cadarache Agency and TechnoPlus Industries (CNIM affiliated company).

The CNIM Group is deeply involved in the ITER program since 2008, though various contracts covering the above activities.
